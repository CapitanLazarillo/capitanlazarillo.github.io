# Capitán Lazarillo iOS App

Capitán Lazarillo is an app designed for visually-impaired sailors. The app provides acoustic and haptic feedback for navigation. To take advantage of the app, the user should be using headphones. When doing water sports such as sailing, water-proof bone-conduction earphones are recommended. For haptic bands, please contact [Yes We Sail](yeswesail.org).
